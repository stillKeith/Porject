# Introduction #

# Detailed Discussion #
* why is it important 
* any industry standards 
* who are the users and how is it used

# Existing Applications #

* what other products are out? (Climate.org, bayes impact )
* whats better 

# Platform, Technologies #

* Ill be using weka as its the easist for me. there are better tools but they would require more time learning how to effectly use them rather the getting results. this would be wasteful on my part to this. (R, python ) 

* cloud services like aws are avaiable but im not expecting to use them because i wont be using large amount of data so with be able to run it on my computer within a reanaable timeframe.
