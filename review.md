# The use of big data in Agriculture #

With more people having access to more information then ever before and advancing technology vast amounts of data have been stored leading to new analytical approaches and the creation of big data (Kshetri , 2016).
 Big data is capture, storage and analysis of large datasets. It is used to gain value from datasets and spot trends which otherwise may have gone unnoticed (Press ,2014). Big data is processed and characterised by volume, velocity, variety and variability (Kshetri , 2016).
Big data has a wide range of uses most commonly in economics , healthcare and marketi ng. (Kshetri, 2016). With the advancement of technology  big data has become of interest of the Agricultural sector (Sparapani , 2017).  Noyes (2014) states  that  smart agriculture, which includes agricultural mapping using Big data for GPS coordinates and planting has generated an enormous amount of information that can help and advance farming technology. Farmers have always used the information but with big data it should allow them to use it in a more efficient way(Majumdar , et al., 2017) 
Big data can be applied to several areas of farming from maximising crop yield to machinery downtime(Perlman 2017).  
According Perlman (2017) one of the leaders in big data for agriculture is John Deere. John Deere added sensors to record weather, soil conditions and crop features. This data should then help farmers reduce fuel costs and mange their machinery to reduce downtime. Brown (2017) states that despite the interest in improving crop yield the investment is still too large for most to afford, with            crop prices falling.  However the use Smart Farming can be of great benefit of farmers by aiding livestock monitoring and collecting water and fuel levels (Beecham Research Ltd, 2014). 
Review has been done according to the following criteria - the references chosen were not older than 4 years and were primarily talking about Big data and its use in agriculture as well as the effects on it. The research has concentrated on the smart agriculture, efficiency, costs and potential benefits of big data use. 


# History of farming in Europe #

Agriculture is one of the most basic activities for humans as it provides us with nourishment. It is also a combination of culture, history and sense of community; moreover it is the closest relationship with land that we have established (International Federation of organic agriculture movement- IFOAM, 2013). Farming is also the basic tool for population to expand rapidly under the right conditions (Feehan, 2003).  Agriculture has developed in many regions of the world simultaneously, around 10 000-15 000 years before the present (BP). In Europe, the first traces of farming were found around the areas of the Mediterranean Sea, especially around Franchthi Cave in south-eastern Greece. Farming has developed in Europe through centuries, from first plants to domesticated animals such as pigs, goats, sheep and later on, cattle (Gray, 2014). Farming moved to Europe from South-West Asia and was mostly developed in the parts with fertile soil that have accumulated in valleys, lakes and plains after the Ice Age (Feehan, 2003). When agriculture spread to more temperate regions in Europe, more plants were cultivated, such as millet, oats and barley (Robuchon and Montagne´, 2001). Agriculture became part of everyday life for different cultures across Europe and the settling on different territories began (Feehan, 2003). By 5000 BP farming was very common in Europe; many improvements developed during Ancient Greek and Roman times. Agriculture flourished and even though half of the yearly crop was used as seeds, grains were exported from the Roman Empire to Britain and further. Through medieval times the farming system changed and more forest changed to farming land in order to meet the needs of expanding population (Gray, 2014).  Because of an ever expanding world’s population that rose from less than a billion to six billions between 1800-2000, agriculture had to follow up with an even faster , 10 fold  in the same period (Federico, 2009). The effect of the increased need for food production changed the method of farming worldwide in 1950's according to Novotny (1999) - smaller farms became larger mono-cultural farms with intensive production in which yields increased dramatically. For the continuous success of intensive production and high yields of crops large quantities of fertilizers and pesticide were used.   Agriculture has become very non-environmentally friendly and as the ever growing world population needs more food, there is also the need of for sustainable and more environmentally friendly farming. Since its origins, agriculture was an essential part of human culture as it has provided people with clothing and heating as well as food, for centuries. At one time, it employed most of the population while nowadays food production is a small primary sector in the industry but it still serves the same purpose, to produce the food we need (Federico, 2009).
